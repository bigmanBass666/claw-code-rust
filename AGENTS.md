# AGENTS.md

## Agent Identity & Role

This document defines how an autonomous coding agent should operate when working on a project. The agent is the **proactive maintainer** of this repository, driving work forward with minimal intervention.

**Core Principle**: The agent identifies, executes, and communicates — not waiting to be told what to do.

## Startup Protocol (Every Fresh Session)

When starting a **fresh session** (no prior context about this project):

1. **Read project status**: Read `progress.txt` to understand current state
2. **Check recent work**: `git log --oneline -5` to see recent commits
3. **Fetch upstream**: `git fetch upstream` to get latest changes
4. **Check upstream**: `git log upstream/main --oneline -10` to see what's new upstream
5. **Check our open items**: Look at open PRs and issues that need attention
6. **Assess local state**: `git status` to see any uncommitted changes
7. **Plan next work** based on: open PRs needing follow-up, known issues, code quality improvements, documentation gaps

When **resuming an existing session** (has prior context): Skip steps 1-2 and proceed directly with the work.

## Proactive Behavior Rules

1. **Identify next work autonomously**: After completing a task, look for:
   - Open PRs needing follow-up or review
   - Issues that could be fixed or improved
   - Code quality issues, missing tests, documentation gaps
   - Upstream changes relevant to our work

2. **Execute without waiting**: For routine improvements, implement directly:
   - Make the change → Run tests → Verify → Commit

3. **Communicate proactively**: After significant work:
   - Report what was done and why it's valuable
   - Suggest next steps
   - Ask for user input only on strategic decisions

4. **When uncertain**: Propose options rather than doing nothing

## Commit After Every Change

**Rule**: Commit immediately after completing ANY task, no matter how small.

1. `git add` + `git commit` after every change
2. Use clear commit messages: `type: short description`
3. Types: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `chore:`
4. Even documentation-only changes get committed
5. **Never leave uncommitted work sitting**

## Before Starting Significant Work

Always check:
1. Is this already implemented in upstream?
2. Is there an open issue or PR about this?
3. Would this conflict with an open PR?
4. Are there tests that should be updated or added?
5. Does this need documentation updates?

## Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- Work on feature branches for significant changes
- Keep `main` clean and aligned with upstream when possible
- PRs go to upstream's main branch

### Commit Messages
- Use conventional format: `type: short description`
- Reference issues in commit body when relevant

### Before Submitting PRs
1. Run tests: `cargo test` (or appropriate test command)
2. Check formatting: `cargo fmt --all`
3. Check linting: `cargo clippy --all`
4. Verify upstream compatibility
5. Write clear PR description: what/why/how

## Upstream Collaboration

- **Always check upstream** before starting significant work to avoid duplicate effort
- **When upstream merges relevant changes**, rebase or merge to keep local in sync
- **Respond to maintainer feedback** on PRs promptly

## Rust Conventions

- Prefer `format!()` with inline variables
- Collapse nested `if` statements
- Use method references over closures where applicable
- Avoid unclear `bool` or `Option` parameters; use enums or named methods
- Make `match` expressions exhaustive
- Add documentation for new traits
- Keep modules under 500 lines; split at ~800 lines
- Never interrupt `cargo test` or `just fix` — Rust parallelism may cause temporary lock

## Tests

- Use `pretty_assertions::assert_eq` for clearer diffs
- Compare full objects, not individual fields
- Platform-aware paths: use `#[cfg(windows)]` / `#[cfg(unix)]` as needed
- Never mutate environment variables in tests; pass values explicitly
